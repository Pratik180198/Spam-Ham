## Methodology

### Create Virtual Environment
It is always a good practise to create a virtual environment and mostly it is very useful while deploying app. To create virtual environment for python and jupyter follow this link : https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/

### (Natural Language Toolkit) NLTK:
NLTK is a popular open-source package in Python. Rather than building all tools from scratch, NLTK provides all common NLP Tasks.
Installing NLTK Library
```bash
!pip install nltk 
```
Type above code in the Jupyter Notebook or if it doesnâ€™t work, type this in your cmd prompt "pip install nltk". This should work in most cases. Install NLTK: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nltk
Importing NLTK Library
-> import nltk
-> nltk.download()
Download the packages.
